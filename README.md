# Ubuntu gaming Buddy
This is a simple tool that helps playing games on services like ShadowPC more comfortably.

# What does this tool do?
It allows you to use alt+tab inside of the VM and disables the "This program does not responde - close or terminate?"-Timer.

# How does it do that?

When you activate "Gaming Mode", the Shortcut for Alt+Tab gets disabled and the Wait-Timer for the Nonresponsive window turned off - that way, when you press alt+tab inside of your VM, Ubuntu doesn't capture it, but the VM does - allowing for alt+tabbing inside of that window, that runs the VM, instead of on your actual device.

After pressing "Turn off gaming mode", those values get reset.

# How to use
You can either click the buttons inside of the GUI, or on the Trial Icon.

You can minimize the window to hide it, then you can control the tool via the Trial Icon - right click on it, press open to open the window again or Toggle Game Mode to turn game mode on/off, or quit to quit the program.

The colour of the Icon will change, depending on whether or not gaming mode is turned on or not.


# More features?
I will add features as I think of (and need) them.

If you have ideas or wishes, feel free to tell me and I will probably implement them, if they are not way too complex :)
